<h1>Ashar Farooq</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
    
 <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
    
 <p>I am Ashar Farooq from Long Island, NY and from from Karachi, Pakistan. Having lived half of my life in the United States as a Muslim immigrant, I have realized the long old idea that education is something to fall back on. As a gratitude for my life, I have worked to explore as much as I can and create as many opportunities as I can. I love all things tech and am excited to engage with the intersection of computer science, economics, and data science. </p>

 <p>I am an MIT sophomore currently studying Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science. I am researching, tutoring, and learning during qurantine and Summer 2020. Feel free to check out the different parts of my website for more information about what I am doing, my resume, my contact information, and other information!</p>

 <p>I am currently doing research on algorithmic discrimination and finding equitable ways to use artifical intelligence in domains, such as the criminal justice system and healthcare.</p>

 <p>I am also taking an MIT Experiential Ethics Course(24.133) this summer</p>
