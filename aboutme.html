  <p>I am Ashar Farooq, from Long Island, NY and from from Karachi, Pakistan. Having lived half of my life in the United States as a Muslim immigrant, I have realized the long old idea that education is something to fall back on. As a gratitude for my life, I have worked to explore as much as I can and create as many opportunities as I can. I love all things tech and am excited to engage with the intersection of computer science and impactful products/programs as a recent graduate of MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department.</p>
