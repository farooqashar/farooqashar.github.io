  <p> I am an MIT sophomore studying Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science. Born and raised in Karachi, Pakistan before moving to Long Island, NY, I love to explore different places and cultures. I am passionate about bringing innovation to the vulnerable population. As an example, I recently worked to address the needs of the unbanked and underbanked population. During my first year at MIT, I was involved in numerous student groups, such as PaksMIT and the Muslim Student Association. I also serve on the Class of 2023 Student Council as the Publicity Chair. You can find me playing badminton or hanging out with friends during my free time.</p>

 <p>I am currently doing research on algorithmic discrimination and finding equitable ways to use artifical intelligence in domains, such as the criminal justice system and healthcare.</p>

 <p>I am also taking an MIT Experiential Ethics Course(24.133) this summer</p>
